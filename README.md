## PROBLEM STATEMENT
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), developing countries waste 40 percent food items. Around 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted annually all over the world.
By trimming waste and diverting food loss we can alleviate hunger, create jobs, combat climate change, conserve natural resources, and cultivate more sustainable communities.

## FACTS
Food waste ranks as a top emitter of greenhouse gases estimated at 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere each year.
3.5 billion acres of land, 28 percent of the world’s agricultural area, is used annually to produce food that’s never eaten.
More than 20% of all cultivated land, 30% of forests and 10%of grasslands are undergoing degradation.

## WHAT WE DO
Wasting food means not only money down the drain, but also all of the resources needed to grow and distribute that food in the first place.
Our mission is to make fresh, nutritious food accessible to everyone regardless of their location or socio-economic status.

## HOW IT WORKS
We believe our platform can end hunger by connecting restaurants and people that have excess food to different neighborhood and charities in dire need of food to feed the underprivileged. This moves nutritious food away from the waste stream and onto the plate of someone in need.
Hunger is a distribution problem, not a supply problem.
Together, we can solve it.
